\section{Characters and irreducible representations}
This section is largely based on the book by \cite{RCG}.

Recall that the trace of a matrix is defined to be the sum of its diagonal elements and that the trace satisfies two important equations. Namely
$$tr(A+B)=tr(A)+tr(B) \text{  and  } tr(AB)=tr(BA)$$
For a given representation of $G$, $\rho: G \to GL_n(\mathbb{C})$, we define its character by $\chi_\rho : G \to \mathbb{C}$, $\chi_\rho(g) = tr(\rho(g))$.

\begin{prop}
Conjugate elements in $G$ take the same value under a character.
\begin{proof}
Let $g$ and $g'$ be in the same conjugacy class. Then there exists an element $h$ such that $h^{-1}gh=g'$. Then we have
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\chi(g')=\chi(h^{-1}gh) = tr(\rho(h)^{-1}\rho(g)\rho(h)) \stackrel{\mathclap{\normalfont\mbox{\tiny{*}}}}{=} tr(\rho(g)\rho(h)\rho(h)^{-1}) = tr(\rho(g))=\chi(g)
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
In (*) we use the fact that $tr(AB)=tr(BA)$.
\end{proof}
\end{prop}

\begin{lemma}
For a finite abelian group $G$ any irreducible representation must be 1-dimensional.
\begin{proof}
Let $\rho: G \to GL(V)$ be an irreducible representation. Since $G$ is abelian we have that $\rho(g)\rho(h)v = \rho(h)\rho(g)v$. Thus multiplication by $\rho(g)$ respects the action of $G$ and we have that $\rho(g)$ is a homomorphism of $G$-representations between $\rho$ and itself. Then by Schur's lemma\footnote{Statement and proof of Schur's lemma can be found in the appendix on page \pageref{schur} as \cref{schur}.} $\rho(g)$ must be a scalar multiplication. In other words every matrix $\rho(g)$ for $g \in G$ is diagonal (it is a scaling of identity). This implies that $\rho$ can be written as a direct sum of 1-dimensional representations, but since $\rho$ is irreducible $\rho$ must be 1-dimensional
\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{prop}
If $\chi$ is the character of a representation, $\rho$, with dimension $n$ of a group $G$, and $g$ is an element of $G$ with order $m$, then the following holds
\begin{itemize}
 \item[(1)] $\chi(1) = n$
 \item[(2)] $\chi(g)$ is the sum of $m$-th roots of unity.
 \item[(3)] $\chi(g^{-1}) = \overline{\chi(g)}$
\end{itemize}
\begin{proof}

\begin{itemize}
\item[]
\item[(1)]
The first result is immediate.
$$\chi(1) = tr\left(\begin{pmatrix}
1 & \cdots & 0\\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
0 & \cdots & 1
\end{pmatrix}\right) = n$$
\item[(2)]
Since $\langle g \rangle$ is an abelian group, $\rho$ decomposes into $n$ 1-dimensional $\langle g \rangle$-representations. Then there is a basis such that $\rho(g)$ is diagonal. Since $g$ has order $m$ it follows that the diagonal entries of $\rho(g)$ must be $m$-th roots of unity. Thus $\chi(g) = tr(\rho(g))$ must be the sum of $m$-th roots of unity.
\item[(3)]
Using the same basis as above and the fact that $\omega^{-1} = \overline{\omega}$ when $\omega$ is a root of unity we see that $\chi(g^{-1}) = tr(\rho(g)^{-1}) = \overline{tr(\rho(g))} = \overline{\chi(g)}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
\end{prop}


\section{Krull-Remack-Schmidt}
This section is largely based on the book by \cite{CMR}.
Here we will prove the Krull-Remack-Schmidt theorem for complete local noetherian rings.

We say a ring satisfies Krull-Remack-Schmidt if the following condition holds:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)] Any finitely generated module can be written as the finite direct sum of indecomposable modules.
	\item[(ii)] If $$\bigoplus_{i=1}^m M_i \cong \bigoplus_{j=1}^n N_j$$
	for indecomposable $M_i$'s and $N_j$'s, then $m=n$ and there is a permutation, $\sigma \in S_n$, such that $M_i \cong N_{\sigma(i)}$ for all $i=1,2, \cdots, n$.  
\end{itemize}

It's clear that (i) holds for any noetherian ring, since any decomposition of a noetherian module must eventually reach an indecomposable. In this chapter we will focus on proving (ii).

------------------

Next we consider $\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{F}(P)) = S \otimes_\C P/\mathfrak{m}P$. We have already seen that it's projective. Both $P$ and $S \otimes_\C P/\mathfrak{m}P$ have a natural projection onto $P/\mathfrak{m}P$, and by projectivity we get an induced $S\#G$-linear map from $S \otimes_\C P/\mathfrak{m}P$ to $P$:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
& S \otimes_\C P/\mathfrak{m}P \arrow[twoheadrightarrow]{d} \arrow[dashrightarrow]{dl}\\
P \arrow[->>]{r} & P/\mathfrak{m}P
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
Now by \cref{lem:radical small} we have that $\mathfrak{m}P$ is small and that therefore the induced map is an epimorphism. Similarly we get an epimorphism in the other direction. Since $S \otimes_\C P/\mathfrak{m}P$ has finite $S$-rank ($P$ finitely generated {\color{red}{Why is P finitely generated? This would be true if P/mP is indec CG-module, so if thats clear this should be clear}}), it follows that the map is an isomorphism of $S$-modules. Since the map is $S\#G$-linear it is therefore also an isomorphism of $S\#G$-modules.
\end{proof}


\begin{proof}
To see that this are bijections we will show that they are mutuall inverses. First to see that $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{G}(W)) \cong W$ we simply look at the definition
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\frac{S \otimes_\C W}{\mathfrak{m}S \otimes_\C W} \cong S/\mathfrak{m} \otimes_\C W \cong \C \otimes_\C W \cong W
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Next we consider $\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{F}(P)) = S \otimes_\C P/\mathfrak{m}P$. Notice that the top of $ S \otimes_\C P/\mathfrak{m}P$ is isomorphic to $P/\mathfrak{m}P$. Then by the uniquness of tops we have that $ S \otimes_\C P/\mathfrak{m}P \cong P$.

The only thing that remains to show is that $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ are well-defined maps with the correct images. Namely that $\mathcal{F}(P)$ is an indecomposable $\C G$-module and that $\mathcal{G}(W)$ is an indecomposable projective $S\#G$-module.

Since $P$ is an indecomposable projective we have that $\mathcal{F}(P)$ is a simple $S\#G$-module. By the natural inclusion $\C G \hookrightarrow S\#G$ $\mathcal{F}(P)$ becomes a $\C G$-module. Assume that $\mathcal{F}(P)$ decomposes as $P_1 \oplus P_2$ as a $\C G$-module. Then since the action of $x$ and $y$ are trivial on $\mathcal{F}(P)$, $P_1 \oplus P_2$ is a decomposition of $S\#G$-modules. This implies that $P_1 = 0$ or $P_2=0$, and we have that $\mathcal{F}(P)$ is indecomposable.

Lastly we want to show that $\mathcal{G}(W)$ is projective and indecomposable. Since $S \otimes_\C W$ is free as an $S$-module it follows from \cref{lem:S proj => SG proj}, that it is a projective $S\#G$-module. To see that it is indecomposable, we just need to notice that its top, $S/\mathfrak{m} \otimes W \cong W$, is simple.
\end{proof}

---------------------------

First we should show that this is a projective resolution. Note that since the maps are $S\#G$-linear, showing that it's a minimal free resolution as an $S$-module implies it is a minimal projective resolution as an $S\#G$-module. Then what we need to show is 
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] $\Cok \partial_1 = \C$
\item[(ii)] $\partial_{p-1} \circ \partial_{p} = 0$ for all $p$
\item[(iii)] $\Image \partial_{p+1} = \Ker \partial_p$ for $p \geq 2$
\end{itemize}
(i) is clear since the image of $\partial_1$ is $\mathfrak{m}$. (ii) can be shown through a quick computation
\begin{align*}
\partial_{p-1} \circ \partial_{p}(s \otimes x_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge x_{i_p}) &=\\ 
\partial_{p-1} \left(\sum_{j=1}^p (-1)^{j+1} sx_{i_j} \otimes x_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \hat{x}_j \wedge \cdots \wedge x_{i_p} \right)&=\\
\sum_{j=1}^p (-1)^{j+1} \Bigg(\sum_{k=1}^{j-1} (-1)^{k+1} sx_{i_j}x_{i_k} \otimes x_{i_1}\wedge \cdots \hat{x}_{i_k} \wedge \cdots \wedge \cdots \hat{x}_j \wedge \cdots \wedge x_{i_p}& +\\
\sum_{k=j+1}^{p} (-1)^k sx_{i_j}x_{i_k} \otimes x_{i_1}\wedge \cdots \hat{x}_{i_j} \wedge \cdots \wedge \cdots \hat{x}_k \wedge \cdots \wedge x_{i_p}\Bigg) &
\end{align*}
From here we notice that the term with $j < k$ is canceled by the term where $k < j$, because they are the negatives of each other. Thus the composition is 0. This would then imply that $\Image \partial_{p+1} \subseteq \Ker \partial_p$, so for part (iii) we need only show that $\Ker \partial_p \subseteq \Image \partial_{p+1}$.

First some notation: let $\mathfrak{I}_p$ be the set of all tuples $(i_1, i_2, \cdots, i_p)$ with $i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_p$ and $1 \leq i_j \leq n$, and let $x_I$ denote $x_{i_1} \wedge \cdots x_{i_p}$ when $I=(i_1, \cdots, i_p)$. Then assume $$ \sum_{I \in \mathfrak{I}_p} s_I \otimes x_I$$ is in the kernel of $\partial_p$. 


Maybe just prove n=2, its simpler....

{\color{red}Maybe refferencing the proof will be better... or make an appendix on homological algebra}

---------------------------------

\begin{theorem}
The Koszul complex of a regular sequence is exact everywhere except in degree 0.
\begin{proof}
The proof will be inductive on the length of the regular sequence. Let's first show that it holds when the length of the sequence is 1. Let $M$ be our module, $(x_1)$ our regular sequence, and $V = \Z x_1$. Then we get the following complex
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}
0 \arrow[r] & M \otimes_\Z \bigwedge^1 V \arrow{r}{\partial_1} & M \arrow[r] & 0
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
This is isomorphic to 
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}
0 \arrow[r] & M\arrow{r}{x_1 \cdot -} & M \arrow[r] & 0
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
and since multiplication by $x_1$ is injective on $M$, this is exact in degree 1. Since it is 0 in all degrees except 0 and 1, it is exact there as well. 

For the inductive step we will show a relationship between regular sequences of different lengths. Let $(x_i)_{i=1}^{n}$ be a regular sequence on $M$, and let $K(s)$ be the Koszul complex of the sequnece $(x_i)_{i=1}^s$. Then there is an exact sequence of complexes
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}
0 \arrow[r] & K(s) \arrow{r}{\iota} & K(s+1) \arrow{r}{\pi} & K(s)[-1] \arrow{r} & 0
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
where $K(s)[-1]$ is $K(s)$ shifted one spot to the left. The short exacts equence is given by
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}
\cdots \arrow{r}{\partial_3^s} & 
M \otimes_\Z \bigwedge^2 V_s \arrow{r}{\partial_2^s} \arrow{d}{\iota_2} & 
M \otimes_\Z \bigwedge^1 V_s \arrow{r}{\partial_1^s} \arrow{d}{\iota_1} & 
M \arrow[r] \arrow[d, equal] & 0 \arrow[d]\\
\cdots \arrow{r}{\partial_3^{s+1}} & 
M \otimes_\Z \bigwedge^2 V_{s+1}\arrow{r}{\partial_2^{s+1}} \arrow{d}{\pi_2} & 
M \otimes_\Z \bigwedge^1 V_{s+1} \arrow{r}{\partial_1^{s+1}} \arrow{d}{\pi_1} & 
M \arrow[r] \arrow[d] &  0 \arrow[d]\\
\cdots \arrow{r}{\partial_2^s} & 
M \otimes_\Z \bigwedge^1 V_s \arrow{r}{\partial_1^s} & 
M \arrow[r] & 0 \arrow[r] & 0
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
where $\iota$ is just the inclusion and $\pi_{j+1}(m \otimes x_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge x_{i_{j}} \wedge x_{s+1}) = m \otimes x_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge x_{i_{j}}$, and 0 if $x_{s+1}$ does not appear in the wedge product.

This short exact sequence induces a longe exact sequence on homology
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\cdots \ar[r] & H_2(K(s+1)) \ar[r] & H_1(K(s)) \ar[r] & H_1(K(s)) \ar[dlll, overlay, in=170, out=-10] \\
H_1(K(s+1)) \ar[r] & H_0(K(s)) \ar[r] & H_0(K(s)) \ar[r] & H_0(K(s+1)) \ar[r] & 0
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
Now we assume by induction that $K(s)$ is exact in all non-zero degrees. Then we get the following long exact sequence
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\cdots \ar[r] & H_2(K(s+1)) \ar[r] & 0 \ar[r] & 0 \ar[dlll, overlay, in=170, out=-10] \\
H_1(K(s+1)) \ar[r] & M/I_sM \ar[r]{}{x_{s+1} \cdot -} & M/I_s \ar[r] & M/I_{s+1}M \ar[r] & 0
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
where $I_k = \langle x_i \rangle_{i=1}^k$. Then since the sequence is exact we get that $H_i(K(s+1)) = 0$ whenever $i \geq 2$, and that $H_1(K(s+1))$ is isomorphic to the kernel of multiplication by $x_{s+1}$. Here we use the fact that the sequence is regular, which means that multiplication by $x_{s+1}$ is injective on $M/I_sM$ and therefore $H_1(K(s+1)) = 0$.

Then by induction we have shown that $H_i(K(n)) = 0$ for all $i \neq 0$, or in other words that the Koszul complex is exact in all degrees except 0.
\end{proof}
\end{theorem}
